         <h2>About This Site</h2>
          <p>This site is inspired from the poem 'The Tripping Tadpole' (Rin Rin Renacuajo)
            by Colombian poet Rafael Pombo. I came across this story when I was about 6 years old.
            At the time, my mom was working as a housemaid at a friend's house. I would often visit her at work
            since the house was only a block from ours. One day I saw a children's books laying on the dinning table.
            It was a small, hard-cover book with bright colors and a smiling frog on the front.
            Out of curiosity I picked up the book and skimmed through the pages. It wasn't long before my mom
            scolded me for taking stuff that wasn't mine, and swiftly took the book.
            I begged her to let me look at it for a bit more, but she refused. I can't say I was
            devastaded but I was pretty bombed out.
            Then the next day my mom took me downtown after her shift and bought me my very own copy.
